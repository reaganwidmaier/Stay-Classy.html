      <h1>French Fries</h1>
      <p class="pink">There are many different styles of french fries. Some of my favorites are shoe string and waffle fries.</p>
      <p class="white">My favorite place to get shoe string french fries is McDonald's. They are salty, crispy, and overall delicious.</p>
      <p class="navy">My favorite place to get waffle fries is Chick-Fil-A. This is also my favorite fast food restaurant and their fries is one of the many reasons that it's my favorite.</p>
